# BCG-Data-Science-Analytics-Virtual-Experience-Program

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for the BCG Data Science & Analytics Virtual Experience Program. The program is focused on understanding and solving a customer churn problem for PowerCo, a major gas and electricity utility company.

The program consists of several tasks, each targeting a specific aspect of the problem. The tasks include:

1. Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering & Modeling
4. Findings & Recommendations

## Task 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing

In this task, the goal is to understand the business context and problem statement. The hypothesis to be tested is whether price changes affect customer churn. The task involves formulating the hypothesis as a data science problem, identifying the data needed from the client, and determining the analytical models to be used for testing the hypothesis.

## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis

The objective of this task is to gain a holistic understanding of the dataset provided by the client. It involves performing exploratory data analysis, including examining data types, statistics, parameter distributions, and verifying the hypothesis of price sensitivity being correlated with churn. Additionally, suggestions for data augmentation are provided, highlighting other sources of data the client should provide and potential open-source datasets that may be useful.

## Task 3: Feature Engineering & Modeling

In this task, feature engineering is performed on the cleaned dataset. A specific feature, "the difference between off-peak prices in December and January of the preceding year," has been identified as having predictive power. The task involves running the provided notebook for feature engineering and exploring ways to improve the feature's predictive power. Subsequently, a Random Forest classifier is trained using the engineered features, and the model's performance is evaluated. The advantages and disadvantages of using a Random Forest for this use case are documented.

## Task 4: Findings & Recommendations

The final task focuses on presenting the results and providing recommended actions to the client. An abstract slide summarizing the findings from the project is created for the key stakeholders' meeting. The abstract serves as an executive summary, highlighting the progress made in the project and key insights. The client's quick update request is addressed in this task.

## ðŸ›  Tools and Technologies

The project is implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook. Python's data science libraries, such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn, are utilized for data manipulation, analysis, feature engineering, and modeling.

## Conclusion

The BCG Data Science & Analytics Virtual Experience Program provides an opportunity to work on a customer churn problem for PowerCo. By following the tasks and exploring the code and documentation in this repository, you will gain insights into the business problem, perform exploratory data analysis, engineer features, build a predictive model, and present your findings and recommendations to the client.
